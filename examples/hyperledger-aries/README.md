Hyperledger Aries Agent Deployment using Kubernetes

## Introduction
This repository contains Kubernetes charts for deploying Hyperledger Aries agents. Hyperledger Aries provides a framework for building decentralized identity systems and this set of charts simplifies the deployment process in a Kubernetes environment. These have been used for deploying on AWS Cloud and may require modification for other cloud environments. It is intended to be used to deploy agents that can interact alongside your ledger of choice (aries is agnostic to the verifiable data ledger). The most common option is to leverage an indy network, which can be deployed using Bevel. 

## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster 
- Helm 
- Knowledge of your Kubernetes cluster configuration (e.g., storage classes, ingress controller)
- Basic understanding of Hyperledger Aries and decentralized identity systems

## Installation
- Step 1: Clone the Repository
- Step 2: Configure the Kubernetes Charts
Edit the Helm chart values in chart/values.yaml to suit your deployment environment. Key configurations include:

- You can manually change agent configurations as needed for different deployment strategies. 

- Step 3: Deploy the Aries Agent
Deploy the Aries agent using Helm:

```bash
$ helm install my-aries-agent ./chart
```

Step 4: Verify Deployment
Check the status of your deployment:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
```
Ensure that the Aries agent pods are running successfully.

## Usage
Once deployed, the Aries agent can be interacted with via its exposed service. Depending on your service.type configuration, this may be within the cluster or via an external IP/hostname.

## Customization
You can customize the deployment by editing the Helm chart values. This includes configuring:

Resource limits and requests
Persistence options
Custom environment variables
Additional parameters specific to Hyperledger Aries

### Configuration
Edit values.yaml in the chart/ directory to customize the deployment.
Key configurations: agent parameters, service type, ingress settings.

### Upgrading
To upgrade your Aries agent deployment:
```bash
$ helm upgrade my-aries-agent ./chart
```
Ensure that you review the changelog for any breaking changes or necessary actions before upgrading.

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, check the Kubernetes logs for the Aries agent pods:
```bash
$ kubectl logs [Pod-Name]
```

For more detailed troubleshooting, refer to the Hyperledger Aries documentation.
